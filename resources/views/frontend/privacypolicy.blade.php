                    Canada offers about 120 different immigration pathways for economic class candidates. Here are the most popular options. Do you want to immigrate to Canada as a skilled worker? In 1967, Canada introduced the world’s first ever objective points system to assess whether immigration candidates could successfully integrate into the Canadian labour market. This was done through the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) which continues to be one of Canada’s most prominent immigration pathways. What has changed since 1967, however, is the number of additional Canadian immigration programs now available to skilled workers.

                    Today, Canada offers some 120 different economic class immigration streams. The reason for this is the Canadian Constitution defines immigration as a shared responsibility between the federal government and Canada’s 10 provinces and 3 territories.

                <p>
                    Given how large and diverse the country is, the federal government and provinces operate many different skilled worker streams to address Canada’s diverse economic and labour market needs. This means that Canada has broad immigration programs that select the highest-scoring candidates, and also operates more targeted programs that select immigrants based on their occupational backgrounds. Canada is guided by its Immigration Levels Plan. It is seeking to welcome the highest levels of immigration in its history, over 400,000 new immigrants per year. About 60 per cent of these new immigrants will arrive to Canada under the economic class as skilled workers and business immigrants. About 25 per cent will arrive through family sponsorship, while the remaining 15 per cent will be welcomed as refugees. Here is an overview of the most prominent options available to skilled workers
